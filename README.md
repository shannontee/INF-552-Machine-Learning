  Multi-class and Multi-Label Classification Using Support Vector Machines </b> <br/>
  Using one vs. all classifier to train a SVM for each of the labels using Gaussian kernels and L1-penalized
  
  <b> K-Means Clustering on a Multi-Class and Multi-Label Data Set </b> <br/>
  Perform K-Means Clustering on data set and determine majority labeling by reading true labels to calculate the Hamming score
  
  <b> Homework 6: <br/>
  Supervised, Semi-Supervised, and Unsupervised Learning </b> <br/>
 Examine results of different supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning methods on the same dataset.
