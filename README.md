# INF 552 - Machine Learning
Practical applications of machine learning techniques to real-world problems.

<b>Homework 1: Classification using KNN on Vertebral Column Data Set </b> <br/>
Explore the influence of different values of K, distance metrics and voting methods on the results


<b>Homework 2: Linear Regression on Cycle Power Plant Data Set </b><br/>
Start with simple linear regession for each feature, then do multiple regression, and add nonlinear terms and interaction terms to the model. Finally compare the results of linear regression with KNN regression

<b> Homework 3: Human Activity Time Series Classification </b><br/>
Feature extraction from time series:
- Logistic Regression with Recursive Feature Elimination
- L1-penalized logistic regression
- Naive Bayesâ€™ classifier with Gaussian/Multinomial priors

<b> Homework 4: <br/>
  LASSO and Boosting for Regression on Community Crime Rate Prediction </b>
  - Ridge/LASSO Regression
  - PCR
  - Boosting Tree (XGBoost)
  
  <b> APS Failure data Classification using Tree-Based Methods </b> <br/>
  - Random Forest
  - Handling Class Imbalance
  - Logistic Model Tree by Weka
